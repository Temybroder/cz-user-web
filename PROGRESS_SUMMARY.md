## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Test existing flows** before adding new features
2. **Fix meal plan generation** - this blocks subscriptions
3. **Test subscription flow** - critical business feature
4. **Fix order checkout** - most important revenue flow

### Long-term:
1. Add comprehensive error handling
2. Implement loading states everywhere
3. Add data validation on frontend
4. Optimize API calls (caching, batching)
5. Add comprehensive logging

---

## 🐛 KNOWN ISSUES TO WATCH

### Potential Issues Not Yet Tested:
1. **Meal plan AI integration** - may have API issues
2. **Payment gateway** - Paystack integration needs verification
3. **WebSocket connections** - Socket.io for real-time updates
4. **File uploads** - Product images, profile pictures
5. **Push notifications** - Firebase integration
